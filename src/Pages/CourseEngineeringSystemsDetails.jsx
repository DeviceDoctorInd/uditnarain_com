                                        One of the oldest and  broadest engineering disciplines, Mechanical engineering is a discipline of  engineering that applies the principles of physics and materials science for  analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is  the branch of engineering that involves the production and usage of heat and  mechanical power for the design, production, and operation of machines, tools,  physics and material science for the design, analysis, manufacturing and  maintenance of mechanical systems.<p></p>
                                        <p>A  course in mechanical engineering makes a student gain knowledge and experience  in the designing of electric motors, automobiles, aircrafts and other heavy  vehicles. Mechanical engineering demands knowledge about software used in  technical work like computer-aided design and mathematical modeling. Typical technologies in which mechanical engineers  find employment are manufacturing processes, materials engineering, energy  conversion and conservation systems, and mechanical design. In addition to  employment in industry, mechanical engineers also work in government,  management, consulting, and academic organizations.</p>
